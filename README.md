# Tic-Tac-Toe
Personal project for the practice of implementing the Minimax algorithm.

One game mode so far:
- Play against the AI on a 3x3 game board
- Can keep playing until you get tired!

Aspirations: 
- implement A-B pruning minimax
- create varying levels of AI

Thanks to Ben from "MakinggameswithBen" (https://www.youtube.com/user/makinggameswithben) for peaking my interest in creating this game and for some very helpful code.
